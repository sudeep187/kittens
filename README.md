Helloooooo. This is a source code for my react app kittens. Here you can search for a kitten from the bundle of kittens.
Highlights: * This is made from react.js
            * The pictures of kittens and its data are obtained by making an api call.
            * Lifecycle methods are used.
            * States in react are used.
